Essays
------

This is just a repository of essays and/or blog posts that I'm working on. 
Things go in here while they're still works in progress, sometimes as super
minimal stubs even.  So, be aware when reading through the in-process
folder.

Also be aware that things like spell checking, copy editing, have not
necessarily occured yet.  I do NOT invite feedback of that kind here.  (If I
want help copy editing you'll know because I'll have asked you.  =p) 

That said, comments on the content of the essays is welcome. Doing this sort
of thing is public is a bit of an experiment for me.
