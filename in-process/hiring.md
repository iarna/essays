Hiring
======

Hiring is hard, and everyone is bad at it. With the knowledge that no one is
good at picking out who will be successful and who won't be, how do we make
rational hiring decisions?

Interviews should be treated much as contract negotiations are: As
formalized communication. Your goal is to see if that what you're asking
for and what the applicant is offering are in alignment. It is not to judge
them. Rather, it is only once we've seen actual work from someone that we can
judge them.

But hiring is more than just an interview, it ultimately digs deep into the
heart of a company and often reveals what (if any) core values they actually
have.  As such, beyond just job ads, phone screens and interviews, we'll be
touching on everything from titles, to compensation, to internal
advancement.

Understanding the position
--------------------------

First of all, you need to articulate what the business goal is of filling
this position.  That is, specifically want does the business hope to get
from the new hire.  This can be necessarily vague and that's ok, as the
actual specifics of day-to-day work are often molded by the person in the
position.  But things like "increase velocity on X", or "reduce Y's
workload", or "unbottleneck Z", or "create new thing A".

*[Note: If your company already does this, great! But in my experience this
is kept vague and not clearly articulated.  Nor is it shared with everyone
involved with the hiring process.]*

From this, you should also be able to articulate what job titles you would
hire for this position.  That is to say, what levels of experience you're
looking for and compensation you'll provide.  It is entirely possible for
positions be fillable by the full range of experience.

Titles
------

Having well defined titles is very useful for potential employees. In
particular, it helps give a shorthand to people for what they may be
qualified for and what they should expect regarding compensation. And it
helps to keep the company honest in terms of compensation too.

Titles should be clearly defined and publically documented. There should be
a section of the corporate website that lists titles, responsibilities and
pay rates.  (Even more preferable would be having pay be entirely
transparent, but that's a harder sell.) This is something common to very,
very large institutions and government and when done wrong can feel stifling
and beuarocratic, so care is required.  When done right, it empowers
employees to demand the compensation they deserve and makes it much easier
to handle promotions consistently.  This helps reduce favoratism and
unconscious bias, or, at worst, makes such distortions of the system more
visible and thus easier to address.

*A note on whimsical titles:* Many small companies end up giving some
employees, particularly those in positions of power, whimsical titles.  This
is can be fine, but does run the risk of putting these people on a pedestal,
even when they're self-deprecating.

Compensation
------------

Compensation should be public knowledge. If you can't publically defend the
decision that person A makes more than B then it probably isn't justified. 
This is a hard sell, as many people seem to treat compensation as deeply
private.

If you can't bring yourself or your company to make compensation public, at
least make public compensation ranges for each job title.

Designing the job ad
--------------------

* Remember this is an ad, it's about selling. So start with why they should be
  excited about this job.
* Talk about what makes it appealing.  This needs to be focused on what the
  work itself is, not fringe benefits. BE SPECIFIC.
* Talk about your company and your values. Again, you want them to be excited
  about getting to work for you.
* Be sure to make sure people are aware of things that might be potential
  deal breakers too, so as to not waste anyone's time.
* Include a salary range based on the range of titles you would be willing
  to hire for this position.

At each stage below, the applicant should be made aware of what the
company's goals are-- this is important because it helps align both their
expectations and their actions.

*[Todo: Examples, good, bad job ads]*

First contact
-------------

When first receiving something from a candidate, acknowledge receipt and
give them a sense of what the process will be.

Resume reading has one goal
---------------------------

* Determine if from the facts in the resume, the applicant can do the work specified.
* In the case of ambiguity a phone screen can be used to clear it up.
* Interviews for all of the people who meet the criteria.
* I love portfolios of work (eg, currated lists of github modules) as much
  as the next person, but the reasons that this is a harmful criteria have
  been well documented elsewhere. *[Note: Rare enough that perhaps not worth
  addressing. I almost never see these.] [Note: Actually, provide some
  advice on how to approach a portfolio. That is, read it like the resume,
  looking to see if it answers the question "can this person do our job."]
  [Note: Also find that MVC article on issues around this sort of hiring]*

Phone screens
-------------

Goals:

* Clarify anything about the resume. If a deal breaker knowledge wise is
  encountered, thank them for their time an end it there.
  * This means it's appropriate to ask "We need someone who has experience
    with xyzzy, but I don't see that on your resume.  Do you have any
    experience with it or something like it?"
  * Similarly, it is legitimate to ask "I see you list xyzzy, what have you
    done with it", but not to give a quiz to "prove" they know it.
* Answer any further questions about the company and position.
* Provide an opportunity to sell the applicant on the work, the company,
  the culture.

Interviews
----------

Interviews need not be in person, but people are often more comfortable
meeting face to face.

Goals:

* Make sure the applicant understands what you want for them and help you
  understand what they would want from you. That is, prior knowledge you
  need them to have to start.
* Share information they would need to know in order to decide on working
  there, eg compensation, benefits, etc.
* Primarily about selling the company-- meet the team really is about doing
  initial introductions, eg, chat about what you do and how that would
  interact with the applicant's position.

*[Note: Something here about standizing your question list. For software
development in particular, standard open ended questions and a standard
rubric for scoring answers.  Needs examples.  Talk about different sorts of
questions for different skill levels, eg, what's appropriate for a senior
person isn't appropriate for someone fresh out of college.  Also talking
about limiting length.  6-8 hour interview marathons are disrespectful and
of dubious utility.]*

Do not let anyone sit after an interview for more then a day or two.  If no
other interiews are currently scheduled, immediately make the decision. 

Next Step
---------

Provide the applicant with a real problem to solve, eg, bug, small new
feature, and let them do this without joining the company.  Have them sign
an NDA and then give the access / instructions to do the work.  Pay them at
a reasonable rate for the number of hours you expect them to spend on it. 
Make decision to bring them full time on the basis of this work.

It's worth noting that it might be plausible to have multiple people
complete this step at the same time.  Possibly even with the same work, if
the company can afford to pay for the rework.

In the end, if you can't distinguish two or more candidates then one can use
other criteria to select between them, eg, diversity goals.  Failing even
that, flipping a coin is legitimate.  *[Note: Or hire both/all if budget allows]*

*[Todo: Notes on diverse hiring. How you do this. Much of this process is
designed to eliminate existing systemic bias, but how would you integrate
quotas that aim to maintain diversity that matches the population?  It's not
difficult, but deserves discussion because most people haven't thought about
it practically.]*
