## Making your own cheesy URL shortener

So, a while back I wrote my own own URL shortener, so you get things like
http://[...]/1 pointing at this article.  It's actually really easy,
so I thought I would share.

But first you may be asking, but Rebecca, why would you want to make your
own?  Just use bit.ly or j.mp, etc, etc...  Well, for one thing, those URLs
are controlled by companies that are under no obligation to keep your link
alive in the future.
